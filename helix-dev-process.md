@kptdobe and I brainstormed how a typical Helix project would be kicked off and moved through the process from dev to publish (and back). Here are the different stages we came up with, mapped to `helix-cli` commands we expect to be used. The goal of this discussion is to agree on the use cases, so we can: 
* think about how to streamline moving between stages for developers
* write e2e test cases
* simplify the `helix-ci` code?
